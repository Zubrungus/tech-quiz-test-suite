## Description
Using a fully functioning tech quiz as a base, added Cypress component & end to end testing functionality.
## Usage
[Walkthrough video of all tests here.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PsyUGqYp7ulcJYawz4IM3ABp5FGr59xx/view) Clone to a local repository, and run "npm i", "npm run build", and "npm run client:build" then run "npm run start:dev". Leave that CLI running, and in a new instance run "npm run test" to run end to end testing. You can also run "npx cypress run --component" to see component tests.
